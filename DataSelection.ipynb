    "# SELECT DATA OF INTEREST \n",
    "The project focusing on the debate of the right to bear arms in the USA, the first task consists in selecting the data related to this topic. To do so, we use a lexical field (named ***lexical_field*** in the code)  related to the topic, and select only the quotations, which contain one or more words of this lexical field. <br> The determined word bank is the set of the following words: **'mass shooting','gun control','gun violence','2nd amendment','second amendment','gun owning','firearm'**. The way the words have been chosen is explained in the `read.me`.  <br> <br> \n",
    "The selected quotes are then stored in a new data file named `quotes-20__-extended.json.bz2` in form of a dataframe with new columns. The added columns contain information about the speakers (gender, nationality, occupations, age (computed from the date of birth), ethnic group, political party and religion). Such information are taken from the second dataset `speaker_attributes.parquet`, built from wikidata information. Quotations that are not related to any seaker are not kept. <br> <br> \n",
    "**Remark:** For the years 2018 and 2019, we encountered  problem : a QID (*Q99753484*) related to one of the speaker's occupation couldn't be find on the Wikidata. We thus decided to ignore it and didn't save it the fina dataFrame. This is why we added some lines in the code, related to this problem: no information is stored if the code encounter this QID."
