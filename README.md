### Abstract 

A REMPLIR : 150 mots \
The aim of this project is to study how the American perceive the right to bear a firearm. This project is motivated by the numerous mass shootings in the last years in the USA, which have risen a debate in the American society: should the second amendment, which allows everyone to own a gun, be revisited? From citations in the English-speaking journals, the importance of this subject in the journals will be studied. Then, if they exist, the difference of opinions on the gun permit between different social groups in the American society : gender, age, political affiliation, will be highlighted. This to find patterns, the final goal being to develop a model which could predict if a person is pro or against the Second Amendment. 

### Research questions
The first question, we will answer is if the gun permit is a frequent debate in the american journals. Then we will also study the change of frequency between 2015 and 2020 to highlight events like mass shootings, which could have revived the debate. Then we will study if there exists different views on this subject among different part of the population. For example, do women are in average more pro or against gun permit? Then we will try to answer the question:  From the wikidata on the speaker, is it possible to create a model which would give us the probability that a person is pro the right to own a gun? 


### Additional dataset
In this project, we will use two data sets. The first is from Quotebank, an open corpus of quotations attributed to speakers and extracted from journals. In this project we will only use quotations from 2015 to 2020. Certain quotations do not have any speaker, so we got rid of these quotations, for the others we kept the first speaker, as it is the most likely. Moreover we only kept citations which included key words. These kew words have been found using 'Word Bank'. In articles about mass shootings and  gun culture in the USA, 'Word Bank' extracted the most used words, then we kept the ones corresponding the most to our study. 

The second data set is wikidata. For each speaker, we added to the  data frame of the quotations, information about the attributed speaker: nationality, gender, occupation, age, ethnic group, religion and political party. The first part of our project will consist in comparing opinions among american on the gun permit, so in milestone 2 we only kept the american speakers. Concerning the genders, we decided to keep only the two main genders: 'female' and 'male'. As very few quotations are attributed to other genders, it would have been impossible to balance the genders for the observational studies. 

### Methods 
To see if our project is feasible, we need enough data. For 2017, 36000 quotations talked about gun and mass shooting. The study, being carried on 5 five years, enough data are available. We performed a few statistics on these data of 2017. We found that...
