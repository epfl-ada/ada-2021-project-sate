### Abstract 

A REMPLIR : 150 mots \
The aim of this project is to study how the American perceive the gun permit. This project is motivated by the numerous mass shootings in the last years in the USA, which have risen a debate in the American society: should the second amendment, which allows everyone to own a gun, be revisited? From citations in the American journals, our first goal will be to study the importance of this subject, so the frequency in the journals. Then, we will highlight the difference of opinions on the gun permit between different social groups in the American society : gender, age, political affiliation. This to find pattern, the final goal being to develop a model which could predict if a person is pro or against the Second Amendment. 

### Research questions
To make sure we have enough data for our project, we will first check if the gun permit is a frequent debate in the american journals. We will also study the change of frequency between 2015 and 2020 to highlight events like mass shootings. Then we will study if there exists different views on this subject among different part of the population. For example, do women are in average more pro or against gun permit? Then we will try to answer the question:  From the wikidata on the speaker, is it possible to create a model which would give us the probability that a person is pro gun permit? 


### Additional dataset
In this project, we will use two data sets. The first is from Quotebank, an open corpus of quotations attributed to speakers and extracted from journals. In this project we will only use quotations from 2015 to 2020. The second data set is the wikidata information on the speakers of the quotations.
