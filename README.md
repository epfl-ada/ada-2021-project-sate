### Abstract 

A REMPLIR : 150 mots \
The goal of the project is to study how the USA talk about foreign countries. \
We would look for which countries are the most frequent in the American papers and study the context in which they are mentioned (do the journals talk about the economy, the politic, the human rights, the culture, the religion of the country?). By sorting them between positive and negative comments, one can deduce which countries the USA consider as allies and which countries are considered threats.
We could also study differences of opinions before and after a certain event.
